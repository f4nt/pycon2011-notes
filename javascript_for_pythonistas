Javascript for People Who Know Python by Ian Bicking
===============

Details:
-----------------

You know Python. You should know Javascript. The two aren't so different, but this talk will explain exactly how they are different -- lists, dicts, objects, functions, loops and all the other details of Javascript described in terms of Python.

Arguments, everything is optional. You can pass in extra, or less arguments, javascript doesn't care.
undefined is diff than null
undefined is no more magical than null
undefined is falseish
No AttributeErrors... NameError instead.
typeof is slightly magic

talk was really crowded, hard to take notes in. Was cool though
